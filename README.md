# **Google Capstone Project**
I went through the Google Certification program and analyzed a dataset using R. It centered around a bike sharing company located in Chicago. I then took the data and created an interactive dashboard in Tableau detailing how various users (Members or Casual riders) used the bikes. The goal was to find a way to convert casual users to members.
